AI must not:

-Assume the backend already issues JWT tokens

-Add token refresh logic unless explicitly requested

-Replace existing email verification logic

-Suggest token exchange flow — the approach is direct trust

Ignore that mobile app uses Azure tokens stored in AsyncStorage

✏️ If a suggested change modifies token handling, the AI must first explain how it integrates with existing code and show only necessary changes to avoid breaking other features.
