# OAuth Login Fix - Final Resolution

## Problem Analysis
The issue was that the early ban check I added was failing with 404 errors, which was blocking ALL OAuth users (even non-banned ones) from logging in. The logs showed:

1. **Early ban check fails**: 404 error on `/api/users/offenses/{userId}` 
2. **OAuth navigation cancelled**: "no token (likely banned user)"
3. **Backend auth succeeds**: User data shows `"banned": false, "offenses": 1`
4. **User blocked**: Despite being legitimate, user cannot complete login

## Root Cause
- The `checkUserBanStatus` API endpoint was returning 404 errors for Azure AD user IDs
- The early ban check was too aggressive and blocking legitimate users when API failed
- The OAuth navigation logic was checking for tokens that might not be set yet

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Removed Problematic Early Ban Check** (authService.ts)
```typescript
// REMOVED: Early ban check that was causing 404 errors
// The backend already handles ban detection properly during sync
```

### 2. **Fixed OAuth Navigation Logic** (LoginForm.tsx)  
```typescript
// OLD: Checking for AUTH_TOKEN_KEY (unreliable during OAuth)
AsyncStorage.getItem(AUTH_TOKEN_KEY).then(token => {
  if (!token) {
    console.log('OAuth navigation cancelled - no token (likely banned user)');
    return;
  }

// NEW: Checking authState.accessToken (more reliable)
if (!authState?.accessToken) {
  console.log('OAuth navigation cancelled - no auth state (likely authentication failed)');
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Improved HomePage Ban Check** (HomePage.tsx)
```typescript
// OLD: Making separate API call that could fail with 404
const offenseResponse = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/api/users/offenses/${userData.id}`);

// NEW: Using data already in the user response
if (userData.banned || userData.isBanned || (userData.offenses && userData.offenses >= 3)) {
  // User is banned
}
```

### 4. **Kept Backend Ban Detection** (authService.ts)
The backend sync already properly detects banned users and returns appropriate errors:
```json
{"error": "Invalid Azure token: Your account has been banned..."}  
```

## Result
- ✅ **Non-banned users can now login** with Microsoft OAuth
- ✅ **Banned users are still blocked** by backend validation  
- ✅ **Custom modal shows** for banned users (via backend error handling)
- ✅ **No more 404 errors** from problematic ban check APIs
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - login works even if ban checks fail

## Flow Summary
1. **OAuth login initiated** → User clicks "Sign in with Microsoft"
2. **Token exchange succeeds** → OAuth completes normally
3. **Backend sync occurs** → `/api/users/azure-authenticate` called
4. **Ban detection** → Backend checks ban status and user data includes ban info
5. **For banned users**: Backend returns error → Custom modal shows
6. **For normal users**: Login succeeds → User redirected to HomePage

The system now relies on the backend's authoritative ban detection rather than multiple client-side API calls that were causing issues.
