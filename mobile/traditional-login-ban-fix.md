# Traditional Login Ban Check Fix

## Issue
Traditional login was still calling `checkUserBanStatus()` which was causing 404 errors:
```
Ban status check error: {"status":404,"error":"Not Found"...}
```

Even though the user data fetch was working correctly and already included ban information:
```json
{
  "banned": false,
  "isBanned": false, 
  "offenses": 2
}
```

## Root Cause
The traditional login flow had two separate API calls:
1. `checkUserBanStatus(userId)` - causing 404 errors
2. `GET /api/users/${userId}` - working correctly and including ban data

This was redundant and the first call was failing, causing error logs.

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Removed Separate Ban Check** (LoginForm.tsx)
```typescript
// REMOVED: Problematic separate API call
const banStatus = await authService.checkUserBanStatus(userId);
if (banStatus.isBanned) { ... }

// REPLACED WITH: Using data from existing user fetch
const userData = userResponse.data;
if (userData.banned || userData.isBanned || (userData.offenses && userData.offenses >= 3)) {
  console.log('User is banned, preventing login');
  setErrorModalMessage('Your account has been banned. Please contact the administrator for more information.');
  setShowErrorModal(true);
  await AsyncStorage.removeItem(AUTH_TOKEN_KEY);
  return;
}
```

### 2. **Removed Unused Function** (authService.ts)
```typescript
// REMOVED: No longer needed function that was causing 404 errors
async checkUserBanStatus(userId: string) { ... }
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No more 404 errors** in traditional login
- ✅ **Reduced API calls** - more efficient
- ✅ **Same functionality** - banned users still blocked
- ✅ **Consistent approach** - both OAuth and traditional login now use user data for ban checking
- ✅ **Cleaner logs** - no more error noise

## Flow Summary
**Traditional Login:**
1. User enters credentials
2. `authService.login()` called
3. Token received and stored
4. User data fetched via `GET /api/users/${userId}`
5. **Ban check using user data** (no separate API call)
6. If banned: Show modal and clear token
7. If not banned: Continue with account type routing

**OAuth Login:**
1. OAuth flow completes
2. Backend sync includes user data with ban information
3. **Ban check using backend response** (no separate API call)
4. If banned: Show modal via error state
5. If not banned: Continue with navigation

Both flows now use the user data that's already being fetched rather than making separate API calls that could fail.
