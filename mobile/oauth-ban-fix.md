# Microsoft OAuth Ban Check Fix

## Issue
When using Microsoft OAuth login, banned users were being redirected to HomePage first, then shown an "Account Banned" alert, instead of staying on the login page.

## Root Cause
The OAuth authentication flow was completing successfully initially, and the ban check was only happening later in the HomePage, allowing the user to be temporarily authenticated and redirected.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Early Ban Check in OAuth Flow** (authService.ts)
- Added proactive ban check immediately after extracting userId from OAuth token
- Occurs before backend sync and before setting authentication state
- **Location**: Lines ~540-565 in `mobile/services/authService.ts`
- **Behavior**: Shows "Account Banned" alert and redirects to login page immediately

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Check if user is banned before proceeding with OAuth
console.log("Checking OAuth user ban status...");
try {
  const banStatus = await authService.checkUserBanStatus(userId);
  if (banStatus.isBanned) {
    console.log('ðŸš¨ OAuth user is banned, blocking authentication');
    Alert.alert(
      "Account Banned",
      "Your account has been banned. Please contact the administrator for more information.",
      [{ 
        text: "OK",
        onPress: () => {
          router.replace('/');
        }
      }]
    );
    // Clear auth state and stop processing
    await clearStoredAuthState();
    setAuthState(null);
    setIsLoading(false);
    return;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced OAuth Navigation Safety** (LoginForm.tsx)
- Added token validity check before navigation
- Prevents navigation if tokens were cleared by ban check
- **Location**: Lines ~62-88 in `mobile/screens/auth/LoginForm.tsx`

```typescript
// Double-check that we still have valid tokens (not cleared by ban check)
AsyncStorage.getItem(AUTH_TOKEN_KEY).then(token => {
  if (!token) {
    console.log('OAuth navigation cancelled - no token (likely banned user)');
    return;
  }
  // Continue with navigation...
```

### 3. **Updated HomePage Ban Check** (HomePage.tsx)
- Modified to be a fallback check only
- Removed redundant alert for OAuth users (since they're caught earlier)
- **Location**: Lines ~215-235 in `mobile/screens/User/HomePage.tsx`

## Flow Comparison

### Before Fix:
1. User initiates Microsoft OAuth login
2. Token exchange succeeds
3. Auth state is set to logged in
4. User is redirected to HomePage
5. HomePage fetches user info and detects ban
6. "Account Banned" alert shows on HomePage
7. User is redirected back to login

### After Fix:
1. User initiates Microsoft OAuth login
2. Token exchange succeeds
3. **Ban check happens immediately after token extraction**
4. **If banned: Alert shows immediately, auth cleared, stays on login page**
5. **If not banned: Normal flow continues to HomePage**

## Files Modified:
- âœ… `mobile/services/authService.ts` - Added early OAuth ban check
- âœ… `mobile/screens/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Added OAuth navigation safety
- âœ… `mobile/screens/User/HomePage.tsx` - Updated ban check to be fallback only

## Expected Behavior Now:
- âœ… Banned users using Microsoft OAuth will see "Account Banned" alert immediately
- âœ… They will remain on the login page instead of being redirected to HomePage
- âœ… No double alerts or navigation issues
- âœ… Traditional login ban checking remains unchanged and working
