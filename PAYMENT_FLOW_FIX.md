# PayMongo Payment Flow Improvement

## Issue Identified
The original payment flow had a critical flaw: when users clicked "Pay Online" and were redirected to the browser, if they returned to the app without completing payment, the app would still prompt them with "Have you completed your GCash payment?" after a timeout - regardless of actual payment status.

## Root Cause
The app was using a simple timeout mechanism that showed a confirmation dialog without verifying if the payment was actually completed through PayMongo's API.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New PaymentVerificationService
- **File**: `PaymentVerificationService.java`
- **Purpose**: Provides proper payment verification through PayMongo API
- **Key Methods**:
  - `verifyPaymentStatus(String linkId)`: Verifies payment using link ID
  - `verifyPaymentByReference(String referenceNumber)`: Verifies payment using reference number
  - Both return actual payment status from PayMongo (paid/unpaid)

#### Updated PaymentController
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/payments/verify-payment-status/{linkId}`
  - `GET /api/payments/verify-payment-by-reference/{referenceNumber}`

### 2. Mobile App Changes

#### Improved Payment Flow Logic
1. **App State Detection**: Uses `AppState` listener to detect when user returns to app
2. **Automatic Verification**: Automatically checks payment status via API when app becomes active
3. **Smart User Prompts**: Only asks user about payment if verification fails or payment is still pending
4. **Manual Status Check**: Added "Check Payment Status" button for user-initiated verification

#### Key Improvements in Checkout.tsx
- **State Management**: Added `currentPaymentRef` and `currentLinkId` state variables
- **AppState Listener**: Monitors when user returns from browser
- **Payment Verification**: Calls backend API to verify actual payment status
- **Better UX**: Shows appropriate messages based on actual payment status
- **Manual Check**: "Check Payment Status" button for users to manually verify

#### New User Flow
1. User selects "Pay Online"
2. User is redirected to browser for payment
3. When user returns to app (detected via AppState):
   - App automatically checks payment status via API
   - If paid: Automatically proceeds with order
   - If not paid: Shows appropriate message asking user to complete payment
4. User can also manually check status using "Check Payment Status" button

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Completed Payment
1. Click "Pay Online"
2. Complete the payment in browser
3. Return to app
4. **Expected**: App should automatically detect payment completion and proceed with order

### Test Scenario 2: Incomplete Payment
1. Click "Pay Online"
2. Go to browser but DON'T complete payment
3. Return to app manually
4. **Expected**: App should detect payment is not completed and show appropriate message

### Test Scenario 3: Manual Status Check
1. Click "Pay Online"
2. Complete payment in browser
3. Return to app
4. If automatic detection doesn't work, click "Check Payment Status"
5. **Expected**: App should verify and proceed with order

### Test Scenario 4: Network Issues
1. Click "Pay Online"
2. Complete payment in browser
3. Turn off internet temporarily
4. Return to app
5. Turn internet back on
6. Click "Check Payment Status"
7. **Expected**: App should verify payment once connection is restored

## Key Technical Details

### PayMongo API Integration
- Uses PayMongo's `/v1/links/{linkId}` endpoint to check payment status
- Checks the `status` field in response (`paid` vs `unpaid`)
- Extracts `payment_id` from successful payments for order processing

### Security Considerations
- All API calls use proper authentication headers
- Payment verification happens server-side
- No sensitive payment data stored in mobile app

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network errors
- Fallback to user confirmation if API verification fails
- Clear error messages for different failure scenarios

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Payment Detection**: No more false positives from users who didn't actually pay
2. **Improved User Experience**: Automatic detection reduces friction
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear messaging about payment status
4. **Reduced Support Issues**: Fewer cases of incomplete orders due to payment confusion
5. **Real-time Verification**: Uses actual PayMongo API status rather than assumptions

## Configuration Required
- Ensure `PAYMONGO_SECRET` environment variable is set in backend
- Test endpoints are working with provided test credentials:
  - Public Key: `pk_test_piE13zwUmcS6C9mSpeqEmX1P`
  - Secret Key: `sk_test_RgxM2ho9g9kexWcLuByQ37jP`
